/*Write a function for each of the following and test by calling them in main() (required to have user-friendly
messages for outputs of your program).
a) Accept a string and print out all uppercase alphabetical characters (A-Z) in that string.
b) Accept a string then count and return the number of lowercase alphabetical characters (a-z) in that string.
c) Accept a string then print out all digits larger than 5 in that string. Note: to get full point for this question,
your program should print out only once if there are duplicate values.
d) Accept two strings namely str1 and str2 where str2 contains one wildcard '*' character (can represent any
characters). Return 1 if two strings match together and 0 otherwise. Your solution must use loop concept,
not recursion in this question.
Example: str1: "12Hello 34" will match with str2 is "*o 34", "12* 34", "*12Hello 34", "*"  etc.*/
